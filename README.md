## üí° My Developer Philosophy

- I believe maintainable code > clever code.  
- I measure success by how effortlessly users can interact with what I build.  
- X-Ray Vision for messy code ‚Äî I see architecture patterns before the first bug appears.  
- The best UI is the one users don‚Äôt have to think about.  
- Great apps are not just coded ‚Äî they're **designed**, **measured**, and **iterated**.
