## ⚡ Dev Superpowers

- 🧠 I enjoy refactoring large, messy codebases into clean, testable architecture.
- 🧪 Passionate about building apps that improve real-life problems — like health, productivity, and habits.
-  🧭 I reverse-engineer great apps for fun — breaking down their UI/UX and rebuilding them with my own twist.  
- ☕ I sketch wireframes on napkins at coffee shops — because ideas don't wait for Figma.  
- 🧩 I see bugs as puzzles, not problems — the more cryptic, the more satisfying to solve.
