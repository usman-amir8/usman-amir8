# 👋 Hi, I'm Muhammad Usman Amir

I’m a passionate **React Native developer** focused on building user-friendly, scalable mobile apps using **TypeScript** and **clean architecture**.  
Currently diving deep into React Native, Expo, and modern state management to build real-world projects and sharpen my skills.

## 🚀 Projects

### Medicine Reminder App  
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/usman-amir8/Medicine-Reminder)


- **Problem:** Missed doses and inconsistent medication routines put health and recovery at risk — yet, in busy daily life, remembering every pill at the right time can be surprisingly difficult.  
- **Solution:** Turns medication into a perfectly timed habit with smart tracking, adaptive schedules, and real-time reminders — so every dose is always right on time.  
- Built using **Expo**, **React Native**, and **TypeScript** for the frontend, with **Firebase** powering the backend.  
- Features smooth animations for a friendly user experience and reliable real-time notifications to keep users on track.

## 💡 My Developer Philosophy

- I believe maintainable code > clever code.  
- I measure success by how effortlessly users can interact with what I build.  
- X-Ray Vision for messy code — I see architecture patterns before the first bug appears.  
- The best UI is the one users don’t have to think about.  
- Great apps are not just coded — they're **designed**, **measured**, and **iterated**.
